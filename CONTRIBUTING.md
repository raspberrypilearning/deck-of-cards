## Issues

If you find a mistake, bug or other problem, please [open an issue](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/repo-name/issues) in this repository.

## Pull Requests

All edits to a resource should be made to the draft branch, or to a fork of the repo. These patches can then be submitted as a pull request.

If you fix a mistake, bug or problem or have something to contribute, please create a pull request for each modification. Please consider grouping modifications sensibly, i.e. don't bundle typo fixes in the same pull request as code changes, instead file them separately.

Please note that sometimes things are done for pedagogical reasons so changes which make sense from a software engineering perspective (reducing duplication or making use of more advanced programming language features) may not be suitable to maintain the intended educational value.
