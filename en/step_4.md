## Instantiate an object

Let's test out the `Card` class by creating a card object. This object is an **instance** of the `Card` class, so creating the object is also called **instantiating** the object.

+ Underneath your class definition, create a `Card` object called `my_card` which will be the 6 of hearts:

```python
my_card = Card("hearts", "6")
```
