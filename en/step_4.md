Let's test out our `Card` class by creating a card object. The object is an **instance** of the `Card` class, and creating it is also called **instantiating**.

+ Below your class definition, instantiate a card object called `my_card` for the 6 of Hearts:

```python
my_card = Card("hearts", "6")
```

You may be wondering why the card number is `"6"` (a string) and not `6` (an integer). This is because some of the card "numbers" will be `"J"`, `"Q"`, `"K"` and `"A"`!

+ Add a print statement to display the card object.

```python
print(my_card)
```

+ Run the program. 

You will see the text representation of your object â€” it is a `Card`, and you are shown the address of the object in memory:

![<__main__.Card object at 0x000002A437045978>](images/repr1.png)

This description is created by a special method called `__repr__` which returns a text **representation** of the object.

You can **override** the `__repr__` method to change how your object is represented as text.

+ Go back to your `Card` class definition and add in some code to override the `__repr__` method so that it describes the card in a more meaningful way:

```python
def __repr__(self):
    return self.number + " of " + self.suit
```

For example, if `self.number` is `"5"` and `self.suit` is `"spades"`, this will print "5 of spades".

+ Run the program again and check that your new way of representing the object as text works e.g.

![6 of hearts](images/repr2.png)

You can also customise this representation to your own liking.
