## Challenge: what else?

Now that you have created `Card` and a `Deck` classes, what else could you add so that you could use them to program card games? Here are some ideas:

+ Add a `shuffle()` method to randomise the order of the cards in the deck

+ Add a method to check whether a particular card is present in the deck or not

+ Add a `deal()` method to deal cards from the deck. How many cards will you deal to how many players?

+ Could you create a `Hand` class to model the cards stored in a player's hand?
