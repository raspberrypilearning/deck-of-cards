Add a `shuffle()` method to randomise the order of the cards in the deck.

--- task ---

Add a method to check whether a particular card is present in the deck or not.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add a `deal()` method to deal cards from the deck. How many cards will you deal to how many players?

--- task ---

Could you create a `Hand` class to model the cards stored in a player's hand?
