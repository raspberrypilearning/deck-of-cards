## Challenge: add a getter and setter

Now it's your turn. Follow the same principles as in the previous step to add a getter and a setter method for the attribute `number`.

Don't forget:

- In a deck of cards, each card may have a number 1-10 or it may be a picture card (J, Q, K). Think about which data type you will need to use to handle this.
- Think about how you will check whether a valid number has been input in your setter method
