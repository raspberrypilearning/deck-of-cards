## Challenge: add a getter and setter

Now it's your turn. Follow the same principles as in the previous step to add a getter and a setter method for the attribute `number`.

Don't forget:

- In a deck of cards, each card may have a number 1-10 or it may be a picture card (J, Q, K). Think about which data type you will need to use to handle this.
- Think about how you will check whether a valid number has been input in your setter method

# Challenge: aces high?

- Could you add another property which gives you the value of a card as an integer? This might be different for different games - some games count all "picture cards" (J, K, Q) as worth 10, or it depends on the game whether the Ace is high or low. How could you represent the value of a card in your `Card` model without being tied to any particular game?
